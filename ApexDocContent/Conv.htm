  <h2>Account Model Conversion Related Classes</h2>
  <p>The Account Model Conversion utility is an Apex Batch job with a Visualforce frontend that attempts to automate the process of converting
  existing Household objects to Household Accounts for users converting from older NPSP versions.</p>

  <p>The major areas of functionality in the Converter include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New Household Accounts are created for each existing Household</li>
    <li>Non-1x1 Accounts associations to Contacts are removed, new Affiliations created, and Contact Primary Affiliation field is set</li>
    <li>Contacts are disconnected from their 1x1 or Individual Account, and attached to the newly created Household Account</li>
    <li>Opportunities are moved from the 1x1 or Individual Account and attached to the new Household Accounts and Contacts</li>
    <li>Activities and tasks associated with 1x1 or Individual Accounts are transferred to the new Household Account</li>
    <li>Addresses mapped from existing Household and Contacts to new Address objects, then attached to the Contact and Household Account</li>
    <li>Master Household Address set or defined if none exists based on address frequency and Contact giving</li>
    <li>Address overrides are set for any Contact whose address is different from the Household Address</li>
    <li>Primary Contact values are set for all Households</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Nearly all relevent logic is contained in CONV_Account_Conversion_BATCH.  All UI elements related to the page and control can be found in CONV_Account_Conversion_CTRL</p>
