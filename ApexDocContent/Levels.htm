        <h2>Level Related Classes</h2>
        <p>Levels are a custom object that allows the user to specify a "ladder" of levels for any object (the Target),
        based on any numeric field.  The Level defines what the Target object is, what numeric field to look at, and what
        custom field on the Target to save the current level.</p>
        <p>While the creation of Levels was originally designed to support Major Gift levels, it is completely generic
        and can be used in multiple use cases.</p>
        <p>The classes involved with Level object support include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LVL_Level_TDTM - Trigger Handler on Levels, that ensures various fields are correctly set.</li>
            <li>LVL_LevelAssign_BATCH - Batch class that performs the batch process of computing levels for each Target object.</li>
            <li>LVL_LevelAssign_SCHED - Schedulable class that creates the batch processes to compute Levels for each Target object.</li>
            <li>LVL_LevelAssignBATCH_TEST - Tests the batchable class for Level Assignments.</li>
            <li>LVL_LevelEdit_CTRL - Controller for the Edit Level override visualforce page.</li>
            <li>LVL_LevelEdit_TEST - Tests the controller for the Level Edit/New/Clone override visualforce page.</li>
        </ul>
