        <h2>NPSP Settings Related Classes</h2>
        <p>In NPSP 3.0, all of our settings are presented in a common visualforce page. The various settings are 
        grouped into separate 'panels' with a hierarchical menu on the left side of the page that shows/hides the 
        current panel.  Each panel is a separate visualforce page that gets included into the main visualforce page, STG_SettingsManager. 
        Each page's controller derives from the STG_Panel class, and makes use of the Settings Service, STG_SettingsService, which 
        loads up custom settings objects which can be shared across pages.  This way we can easily move UI controls for different settings 
        between visualforce pages, without having to rework how those settings are loaded or saved.</p>
