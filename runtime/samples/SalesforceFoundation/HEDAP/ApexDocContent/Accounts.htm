        <p>HEDA supports 3 distinct types of Accounts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organizational Accounts - these are normal Salesforce Accounts, which typically represent a business, organization, or government agency.</li>
            <li>Administrative Accounts - these are university administrative Accounts, where each corresponds one-to-one with a Contact record.</li>
            <li>Household Accounts - these are Accounts whose Contacts are all members of the same Household</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Account Model that is specified in the Settings dictates which of the non-Organizational Accounts are automatically created and used&npsp;
        when a Contact is created. Administrative and Household Accounts are recommended as the preferred Account Model.</p>
            
	<ul>
        <li>ACCT_CannotDelete_TDTM - Stops an Account from being deleted if it has any Affiliation, Program Enrollment or Course Enrollment children.</li>
		<li>ACCT_IndividualAccounts_TDTM - Trigger Handler on Contacts, that manages creating the appropriate Account for Contacts, when they are created or updated.</li>
	</ul>
