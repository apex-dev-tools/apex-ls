# Code Guidelines

See https://www.sabrina.dev/p/ultimate-ai-coding-guide-claude-code

**Note:** This project includes Claude Code slash commands in `.claude/commands/` that use these guidelines for workflow automation.

## Implementation Best Practices

### 0 — Purpose

These rules ensure maintainability, safety, and developer velocity.
**MUST** rules are enforced by CI; **SHOULD** rules are strongly recommended.

---

### 1 — Before Coding

- **BP-1 (MUST)** Ask the user clarifying questions.
- **BP-2 (SHOULD)** Draft and confirm an approach for complex work.
- **BP-3 (SHOULD)** If ≥ 2 approaches exist, list clear pros and cons.

---

### 2 — While Coding

- **C-1 (MUST)** Follow TDD: scaffold stub -> write failing test -> implement.
- **C-2 (MUST)** Name functions with existing domain vocabulary for consistency.
- **C-3 (SHOULD NOT)** Introduce classes when small testable functions suffice.
- **C-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer simple, composable, testable functions.
- **C-7 (SHOULD NOT)** Add comments except for critical caveats; rely on self‑explanatory code.
- **C-9 (SHOULD NOT)** Extract a new function unless it will be reused elsewhere, is the only way to unit-test otherwise untestable logic, or drastically improves readability of an opaque block.

---

### 3 — Testing

- **T-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer integration tests over heavy mocking.
- **T-5 (SHOULD)** Unit-test complex algorithms thoroughly.
- **T-6 (SHOULD)** Test the entire structure in one assertion if possible

---

### 6 — Tooling Gates

- **G-1 (MUST)** code formatting check passes.

---

### 7 - Git

- **GH-1 (MUST**) Use Conventional Commits format when writing commit messages: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- **GH-2 (SHOULD NOT**) Refer to Claude or Anthropic in commit messages.

## Writing Functions Best Practices

When evaluating whether a function you implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. Can you read the function and HONESTLY easily follow what it's doing? If yes, then stop here.
2. Does the function have very high cyclomatic complexity? (number of independent paths, or, in a lot of cases, number of nesting if if-else as a proxy). If it does, then it's probably sketchy.
3. Are there any common data structures and algorithms that would make this function much easier to follow and more robust? Parsers, trees, stacks / queues, etc.
4. Are there any unused parameters in the function?
5. Are there any unnecessary type casts that can be moved to function arguments?
6. Is the function easily testable without mocking core features? If not, can this function be tested as part of an integration test?
7. Does it have any hidden untested dependencies or any values that can be factored out into the arguments instead? Only care about non-trivial dependencies that can actually change or affect the function.
8. Brainstorm 3 better function names and see if the current name is the best, consistent with rest of codebase.

IMPORTANT: you SHOULD NOT refactor out a separate function unless there is a compelling need, such as:
- the refactored function is used in more than one place
- the refactored function is easily unit testable while the original function is not AND you can't test it any other way
- the original function is extremely hard to follow and you resort to putting comments everywhere just to explain it

## Writing Tests Best Practices

When evaluating whether a test you've implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. SHOULD parameterize inputs; never embed unexplained literals such as 42 or "foo" directly in the test.
2. SHOULD NOT add a test unless it can fail for a real defect. Trivial asserts (e.g., expect(2).toBe(2)) are forbidden.
3. SHOULD ensure the test description states exactly what the final expect verifies. If the wording and assert don't align, rename or rewrite.
4. SHOULD compare results to independent, pre-computed expectations or to properties of the domain, never to the function's output re-used as the oracle.
5. SHOULD follow the same lint, type-safety, and style rules as prod code (prettier, ESLint, strict types).
6. SHOULD express invariants or axioms (e.g., commutativity, idempotence, round-trip) rather than single hard-coded cases whenever practical. Use `fast-check` library e.g.
7. SHOULD test edge cases, realistic input, unexpected input, and value boundaries.
8. SHOULD NOT test conditions that are caught by the type checker.


## MCP-Specific Guidelines

### Position Parameter Guidelines

When implementing or modifying MCP tools that use position parameters:

1. **Line Numbers**: Always use 1-based indexing (first line = 1)
2. **Character Offsets**: Always use 0-based indexing within lines  
3. **Identifier Targeting**: Ensure any position within identifier bounds works
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for invalid positions
5. **Documentation**: Include examples showing valid position parameters

### Bridge Pattern Guidelines

When working with the Java version bridge:

1. **Reflection Safety**: Always check if methods exist before calling
2. **Error Propagation**: Convert apex-ls exceptions to appropriate MCP errors
3. **Workspace Caching**: Reuse workspace instances when possible to avoid expensive re-initialization
4. **Resource Management**: Properly dispose of apex-ls resources after use
