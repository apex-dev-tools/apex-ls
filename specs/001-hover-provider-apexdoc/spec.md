# Feature Specification: Hover Provider ApexDoc Rendering

**Feature Branch**: `[001-hover-provider-apexdoc]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/specify The HoverProvider should provide any ApexDoc comments associated with the class/contructor/method. The ApexDoc structure is defined at https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_doc_intro.htm. class/contructor/method documentation that does not conform to this should not be returned."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Salesforce developer hovers over a class, constructor, or method symbol in their IDE that uses the Apex Language Server; they expect to see the official ApexDoc summary for that symbol when it follows Salesforce's ApexDoc structure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a method with a valid ApexDoc block (summary, parameter, and return tags), **When** the developer hovers on the method signature, **Then** the hover content includes the parsed ApexDoc summary and parameter documentation in a readable format.
2. **Given** a class with a comment that does not follow the ApexDoc structure, **When** the developer hovers on the class name, **Then** the hover content omits that comment and falls back to default type information only.

### Edge Cases
- When an ApexDoc block is partially compliant (e.g., summary present but missing tag closing), the hover response MUST include only the portions that parse cleanly and omit malformed segments.
- ApexDoc that references inherited tags or external links MUST render links in a sanitized format (no executable markup) while preserving visible link text.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The hover response MUST include ApexDoc content only when the associated symbol has a comment that conforms to Salesforce's ApexDoc grammar.
- **FR-002**: The hover response MUST exclude non-ApexDoc comments, even if they are adjacent to the symbol.
- **FR-003**: The hover response MUST present ApexDoc summary text and applicable tag details (e.g., `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`) in the same order defined by the official structure.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST ensure that returned ApexDoc content is safe for Markdown rendering and cannot execute arbitrary HTML or scripts, including sanitizing external links before display.
- **FR-005**: The hover response MUST maintain existing type/location details so downstream IDEs continue to show symbol signatures alongside documentation.
- **FR-006**: The solution MUST support classes, constructors, instance methods, and static methods equally.
- **FR-007**: The hover response MUST degrade gracefully when ApexDoc parsing fails, showing default type/location information without errors to the user.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST display partially valid ApexDoc segments even when other segments fail to parse, without logging debug output for the invalid portions.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Hover Content**: The textual payload returned to the client, combining symbol signature and any compliant ApexDoc summary/tags.
- **ApexDoc Block**: The structured documentation block preceding a symbol, consisting of summary text and optional tagged sections (e.g., parameters, returns, exceptions).
- **Hover Context Symbol**: The resolved class, constructor, or method that the hover request targets.
