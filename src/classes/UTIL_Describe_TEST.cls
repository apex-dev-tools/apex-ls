* @description This class allows easy access to object and field description information from within other classes.
*
* It is called statically, and therefore will supply the same information to all calls made from
* within one transaction, or set of trigger calls. This is beneficial because this info should
* be the same for all calls in a transaction, and by calling it statically we reduce the calls
* that are made, making the total transaction more efficient.
