        <h2>Household Related Classes</h2>
        <p>Households in NPSP are implemented in two different ways. The first implementation in NPSP 2.0 provided a Household Object, that Contacts have an optional lookup field to. In NPSP 3.0, the Household Account model provided a different way to model households, using the Account object.  Where possible, code is shared and provides support for both implementations. The Contact formula field HHId__c helps support this, by providing the Id of the Household Account or Household Object that the Contact is using.</p>
