        <h2>Account Related Classes</h2>
        <p>NPSP supports 4 distinct types of Accounts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organizational Accounts - these are normal Salesforce Accounts, which typically represent a business, organization, or government agency.</li>
            <li>One-to-One Accounts - these are shadow Accounts where each corresponds one-to-one with a Contact record.</li>
            <li>Bucket Individual Account - a special Account that all Contacts who are not associated with a Organizational Account, can use as their Account.</li>
            <li>Household Accounts - these are Accounts whose Contacts are all members of the same Household</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Account Model that is specified in NPSP Settings dictates which of the non-Organizational Accounts are automatically created and used&npsp;
        when a Contact is created.  One-to-One and Bucket Individual Accounts where introduced in early version of the NPSP.  Household Accounts were&nbsp;
        introduced in NPSP 3.0, and are recommended as the preferred Account Model.
        </p>

		<li>ACCT_Accounts_TDTM - Trigger Handler on Accounts, that ensures various system fields are correctly set.</li>
		<li>ACCT_HH_Accounts_TEST - Test code for Household Accounts</li>
