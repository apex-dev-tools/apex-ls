/** A virtual Org used to present the analysis functionality in a familiar way.
  *
  * All analysis works within the context of a virtual Org. You can manage multiple of these at the same time
  * but most use cases just need one creating, see Org.newOrg(). The Org functions as a container of
  * multiple [[Package]] objects and maintains a set of discovered issues from the analysis of the package
  * metadata. All orgs have at least one 'unmanaged' package identifiable by having no namespace.
  *
  * In the simple case after creating an Org, you should add one or more packages detailing where package
  * metadata is stored. Adding large packages can take considerable CPU and memory resources. Once the packages
  * are loaded the metadata within them can be mutated using the [[Package]] methods. At any point you can list
  * of current issues with the packages from getIssues.
  *
  * When metadata changes are requested (see [[Package.refresh]] they are queued for later processing either
  * via calling [[Org.flush]] or via automatic flushing (the default). Flushing also updates a disk cache
  * that helps significantly reduce initial loading times. The flushing model used by an [[Org]] is set on
  * construction, see [[ServerOps.setAutoFlush]] to change to manual flushing.
  *
  * Orgs and Packages are not thread safe, serialise all calls to them.
