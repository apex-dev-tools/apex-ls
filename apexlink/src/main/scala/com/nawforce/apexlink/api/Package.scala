/** A virtual Package constructed from metadata.
  *
  * Packages must be created in the context of a specific [[Org]]. Each Package manages a set of Types which are
  * created from the metadata of the package. Once constructed you can use the package APIs to introspect dependency
  * relationships between Types, obtain summary information about Types and replace or delete Types.
  *
  * A key concept to understand in this API is that a Type may be created from multiple metadata files, e.g. the
  * System.Labels Type is always present but can be constructed from several labels files. The API methods expose
  * Types via the TypeIdentifiers which you don't need to understand to use the API as long as you keep in mind
  * the 1:M mapping between Types and Paths.
  *
  * The term dependency can be rather ambiguous, we use it here to mean a 'using' relationship. So if class A calls a
  * method on class B, we say A has a dependency that is B. The reverse relationship is a 'dependency holder', so B has
  * a dependency holder that is A. Transitives of dependencies or dependency holder relationships are not exposed by
  * these APIs but can be easily obtained by recursive iteration.
  *
  * A Summary provides a way of looking at the structure of Types. In summary form only the most important details
  * are provided but it is essentially free to access since it is the same format used in the disk cache.
  *
  * Packages only handle metadata that is important to Apex class analysis, other forms of metadata that might
  * appear in the package directory are ignored.
